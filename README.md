# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements an image classification model to recognize objects in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cifar10-image-classification

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the training script:
   python src/train.py

4. Explore the results in Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is included and can be loaded using TensorFlow's built-in functions.

## Conclusion
This project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and visualization, providing a comprehensive framework for image classification. You can enhance it further by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, or data augmentation techniques.
